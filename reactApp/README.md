# react-toolbox-example

Webpack Config cloned from https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox-example
Special thanks to the react toolbox team! I still have hair on my head now that Webpack is working.

### Getting Started
1. Run `yarn install && yarn start`
2. Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser

All requests to `/api/` will be routed to the api server via webpack.
